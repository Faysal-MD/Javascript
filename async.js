// synchronous = Executes line by line consequently in a sequential manner
//               code that waits for an operation to complete.

// asynchronous = Allows multiple operations to be performed concurrently without waiting 
//                Doesn't block the execution flow and allows the program to continue
//                (i/o operations, network Request, fetching data)
//                Handled with: Callbacks, promises, Async/await
